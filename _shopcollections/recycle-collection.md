# Recycle collection

The Goat Gang has boarded the RE boat and we are never getting off! So, we’ve come up with yet another awesome project for you guys. In addition to our Goat REmix, we now bring you our REcycle Collection! We are psyched about this one – and we have a feeling you will be too.

The plan was simple: NO to using new resources, and YES to turning old into cool! This collection is made out of 95% recycled denim, yet we’ve kept the vibe as fresh as you know Goat to be. The whole thing has been produced in Italy (near Verona) by a local company called Salgari and we have Pinori to thank for the yarn. Fun fact: The owner of Salgari is a badass old school rocker who happens to have his own vineyard, where he makes his very own vegan wines. Talk about a true Goat Gangster!

**To sum it up:**
* 95% recycled denim
* 5% other materials
* Made in Italy
* Water use, next to none
* Soft touch
* 100% vegan
